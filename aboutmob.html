<p style="font-size: 1.5rem; width: 350px;height: 2350px;padding-left: 1rem;">Charismatic Church was founded in the year 2011 in Ganganadu, a village in Udupi district, in the state of Karnataka, in India. It initially started as a prayer group by Pastor.Paulson Valookkaran Augusthy with his family. As time passed by, people joined the group. The church grew slowly and the fame spreaded. On April,2011 Charismatic Church conducted its first public services. Founded as a nondenominational church, its emphasis was on the basics of Christianity.Worship services were conducted in a small hall at Pastor. Paulson's house. People from many different areas started contacting.
In 2012, services were moved to the newly built chapel at the present location on Ganganadu. Less than a month later, two services were being conducted on Sunday mornings, the first was the Sunday school classes, and Sunday Services. Charismatic Church became known as "the fastest growing and the spiritual Church in the towns nearby". Ten new churches were established under Charismatic Church, one in Hemady and the other in Thudali. Hemady is a village near to Kundapura and is 45kms far from the home church. Thudali is another village near to Shiroor and is nearly 40kms from the home church. Other churches were established in other parts of India including Uttar Pradesh,Punjab,Gujarat. A total of 200 believers are part of Charismatic Church. Also a huge number of people are viritually a part of the church, all over the world.
More important than numbers, programs, and structures, however, is the foundation for the spiritual life of Charismatic Church that has been built. This foundation includes sound doctrine, spiritual leadership, and active service. We are convinced that God's legacy of faithfulness to us will continue in the future if we remain faithful to Him and His Word and are lead by his Spirit.</p>
